            <h1>About The Artist</h1>
            <h2>Hello, I am Divyanshi Verma a passionate self taught Sketch Artist.</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about capturing moments and emotions through the strokes of my pencil. With a keen eye for detail and a love for creativity.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My Journey as an artist has been one of the exploaration and growth. I have an interest in arts since childhood, but my main journey as a sketch artist began in 2022. Since then, I have honed my skills and developed my unique style, drawing inspiration from observing and learning from various sketch artists. Over the years, I have developed my skills through practice, experimentaion and a deep love for art. Each piece is a reflection of my dedication to my art and my desires to connect with other through it. I know that I have to do more work on myself and enhance my skills to achieve my dreams and I am eager to embark on the journey of growth and improvement necessary to reach them because I believe that one day I will make it reality.
